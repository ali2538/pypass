# A simple password generator written in Python using tkinter library

Main Window has options for length, minimum digits and special chars, and provides the ability to turn some options off.

Options for lowercase letters and upper case letters cannot both be turned off at the same time. If one is turned off while the other is also turned off, the other option will be automatically switched on.

Changing the options automatically refreshes the generated password to meet the new requirements.

_on Macs tk has to be installed. One wat to do so in ``brew install python-tk``_
